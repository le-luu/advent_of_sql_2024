First of all, I want to thank Dan Kent and the Advent of SQL team for creating these SQL challenges in December. They provide an excellent opportunity for everyone to practice and enhance their SQL skills. Each day in December, a new SQL challenge is released, offering engaging and thought-provoking problems to solve. As someone who loves using SQL to solve problems, I thoroughly enjoyed tackling these challenges and honing my SQL skills.

### Topics 
The challenges covered a variety of topics, including:

- XML
- JSON
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Recursive queries
- Hierarchies
- Arrays
- Spatial data
- Timestamps and time zones

The challenges were divided into three difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.


### Solution
To solve most of the challenges, I used MySQL Workbench on my computer. However, for challenges related to spatial data or time zones, I opted to use PostgreSQL due to its better support for these features.

For each SQL file, I included comments in the queries to explain my approach to solving the challenge.

### Reflection
- I encountered new concepts like parsing XML data, working with spatial data, and handling time zones and timestamps. It was a valuable learning experience.
- MySQL doesn't support the ARRAY data type, so I converted arrays to JSON and then parsed the JSON to extract the required data.
- Testing the queries was straightforward and user-friendly.
- I particularly enjoyed the challenges involving hierarchies and recursive CTEs—they were both fun and insightful!

If you’re a SQL developer, I highly recommend giving these challenges a try. They’re an enjoyable way to learn and practice SQL. Have fun solving them!
